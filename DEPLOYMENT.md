# Deployment Guide for Bag Application

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Deprecated Package Warnings
- ✅ Removed `xss-clean` (deprecated) and replaced with custom XSS protection middleware
- ✅ Moved `nodemon` to devDependencies
- ✅ Added modern alternatives: `dompurify` and `jsdom`
- ✅ Removed unnecessary `path` package (Node.js built-in)

### 2. Case Sensitivity Issues
- ✅ Fixed import paths for `isLoggedin` middleware in:
  - `routes/wishlistRouter.js`
  - `routes/productsRouter.js` 
  - `routes/indexRouter.js`

### 3. Vercel Configuration
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with proper configuration
- ✅ Modified `app.js` to export the app for Vercel
- ✅ Added proper environment handling for production

### 4. Package.json Updates
- ✅ Updated scripts for production deployment
- ✅ Added Node.js engine specification
- ✅ Organized dependencies properly

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure to set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_KEY=your_jwt_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
Owner_Name=your_name
Owner_Email=your_email
Owner_Pass=your_password
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Connect your repository to Vercel**
3. **Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard**
4. **Deploy!**

The application should now deploy successfully without the previous errors.

## What Was Fixed

The main issue was the missing middleware file due to case sensitivity. The error:
```
Cannot find module '../middlewares/isloggedin'
```

Was caused by importing `isloggedin` but the actual file was named `isLoggedin.js` (capital L).

All import statements have been corrected and deprecated packages have been replaced with modern alternatives.
